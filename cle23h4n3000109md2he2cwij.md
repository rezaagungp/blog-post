# Intro to re-learning JavaScript

It has been a long time since I'm not touching JavaScript probably around half a year, last time I used it is for company tests like creating simple pages and blog apps.

So I decided to do refreshment on JavaScript, there are a few options in my head that how I will do refreshment

* Taking an Online Course this one is good for building fundamentals because structured and easy to understand.
    
* Coding challenge, I am more likely to do this one besides can do coding directly this method also improves problem-solving skills and got a bonus refreshment on data structure, the one is missing for this method I can't explore the framework.
    
* Build some projects, I like this way because there are a lot of tools or parts that can be explored but in some cases, it is not structured and probably will miss the fundamentals.
    

Besides all, the important thing that should be remembered is consistency and commitment. In the middle of the journey, there will be excuses to skip learning like being too busy, project deadline, urgency and etc. This kind of problem that I face when doing refreshments besides working. As a re-learning journey complement, there is also a series about JavaScript that will be written as a note, not sure how often the series will be updated will try to make it 2 weeks for 1 article.
